                                We sat by the window as rain painted abstract art on the glass. You ordered 
                                a cappuccino with an extra shot of espresso, and I watched the foam form 
                                patterns that looked like clouds we'd never see together. Your fingers 
                                traced the rim of the cup as you spoke about books you'd read and places 
                                you'd dreamed of visiting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I remember how you laughed when the barista mispronounced your name, how 
                                you corrected him gently, like you were teaching a child to say "love" 
                                for the first time. The afternoon stretched like honey, golden and sweet, 
                                and for three hours, we existed in a bubble where time forgot to move forward.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When you left, you forgot your scarf. I kept it, not because I thought 
                                you'd return, but because it smelled like the memory of you.
                            </p>

                                In the old library on Fifth Street, we found each other between the stacks 
                                of poetry and philosophy. You were reading Neruda, your lips moving silently 
                                as you absorbed each verse. I pretended to browse the shelves nearby, 
                                stealing glances at the way the lamplight caught in your hair.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We never spoke, but we developed a language of shared glances and knowing 
                                smiles. You'd leave books for me to find â€” Rumi, Hafez, sometimes a novel 
                                with passages underlined in pencil. I'd respond with my own selections, 
                                creating a conversation in marginalia and dog-eared pages.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The librarian thought we were strangers, but we were writing the most 
                                beautiful love story in the spaces between words, in the silence that 
                                libraries hold sacred.

                                The radio played an old jazz standard as you made pancakes from scratch. 
                                Flour dusted your cheek like snow, and when I reached to brush it away, 
                                you caught my hand and pulled me into an impromptu dance. We swayed 
                                between the counter and the stove, careful not to let the pancakes burn.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your head rested against my chest, and I could feel your heartbeat 
                                synchronizing with mine. The morning light streamed through the window, 
                                casting golden rectangles on the kitchen floor where we spun slowly, 
                                lost in a moment that felt infinite.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Later, we ate those pancakes in bed, sharing sections of the newspaper 
                                and planning adventures we'd never take. But in that kitchen, dancing 
                                to music only we could hear, we were everything we'd ever need to be.

                                We planted a garden together in the backyard of a house we never owned. 
                                You chose the flowers â€” lavender for peace, roses for passion, jasmine 
                                for the sweetness of dreams. I dug the holes and you placed each plant 
                                with the tenderness of someone planting hope.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Every evening, we'd sit on the back steps, watching our garden grow. 
                                You'd point out new buds, celebrate the first blooms, mourn the flowers 
                                that didn't make it through the frost. We learned that love, like 
                                gardening, requires patience, faith, and the willingness to begin again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In autumn, when the flowers had given their last performance, we'd 
                                collect seeds for next year's garden. Even in endings, we found 
                                the promise of new beginnings.
